# Vue Authentication and Authorization (PluralSight)

This repository contains the demo application for the Vue authentication and authorization course on PluralSight.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have **Node 14** or above, **npm**, and an instance of **MongoDB** installed. In case you don't want to install the full MongoDB, you can easily take advantage of the [Azure CosmosDB emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=ssl-netstd21).

## Project setup

### Server side

```
cd server
npm install
```

## Client side

```
cd Client
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
run.bat
```

Then open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
